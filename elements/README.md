Elements

###DOM Tree
  * As you hover over elements in the DOM tree, they will automatically highlight on the page.
  * The path to selected element is displayed at the bottom of the window.
  * Inspect a specific element with the ![alt text](/elements/mag.png "Magnifying Icon") or by right clicking an element on the page and click `Inspect Element`
  * Options to edit the content of the DOM are available from the context menu (right click).
  * It can be very useful to copy the CSS or XPath to a selected element.
